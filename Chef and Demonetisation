********QUESTION*************
In a country called Chef Land, there was a lot of monetary fraud, so Chefu, the head of the country, decided to choose new denominations of the local currency ― all even-valued coins up to an integer N should exist. After a few days, a citizen complained that there was no way to create an odd value, so Chefu decided that he should also introduce coins with value 1. Formally, you are given an integer N; for v=1 and each even positive integer v≤N, coins with value v exist.

You are also given an integer S. To handle transactions quickly, find the minimum number of coins needed to pay a price S.

Example Input
4
2 2
1 14
30 10
31 4
Example Output
1
1
3
9
Explanation
Example case 1: One coin with value 2 is sufficient.

Example case 2: We need to use one coin with value 1.

Example case 3: We need 3 coins, each with value 10.

Example case 4: We can use seven coins with value 4, one coin with value 2 and one coin with value 1.
